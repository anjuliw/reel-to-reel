# REEL-TO-REEL

reel-to-reel provides a simple player for ascii animations.

the ascii-player component expects a frames array, with each frame as an escaped(?) string to be placed in a `pre` tag. see examples in the 'models' folder.

### SETTINGS

**currently implemented settings**

displayconsole

playcontrols

speedcontrols

interval

framecount

autoplay

**future settings:**

loop/continuous

### HELP

please to have suggestions for how to negotiate with strings and Ember (safestring?) 
and maybe avoid the pre tags. i.e. another way to compose the model?
